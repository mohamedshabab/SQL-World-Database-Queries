# SQL-World-Database-Queries
This repository contains SQL practice tasks completed using the classic MySQL world database. It includes real-world queries exploring countries, cities, populations, regions, and simple calculations such as GDP per capita. The exercises come from the Week 3 workbook and focus only on tasks that use the world dataset.
